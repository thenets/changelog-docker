There is so much in a logo. It carries the weight of all you do. It goes before you to set the tone for how you will be perceived. It represents you when you can't be directly involved. It's what people attach their feelings to. It's the sticker on a laptop representing an affinity or belief.

For 7 years, we have been primarily known as \"The Changelog podcast\" and our album art is that sticker on a listener's laptop — so we couldn't just carelessly make changes to our logo. We needed to seek out the right help and guidance through the process.

Nearly one year ago we began the process of rebranding The Changelog. But before we get to that, more than two years ago we purchased `changelog.com` for $1,000 in hope of one day taking the [advice of JT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k06fsS9Vjn4) to drop the \"The.\" It’s cleaner.

Today’s software development culture promotes [rapid development methodologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development), [minimum viable products](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), releasing early & often, and the axiom that [\"real artists ship\"](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt). What common thread weaves its way through all of these things?

**SPEED.**

If you haven’t felt the pressure to squeeze one more feature in before the release date, to fix an interface bug “RIGHT NOW!”, to get your product launched before your competition, or to shave a week off of your development schedule then you haven’t been developing software for all that long.

What many people fail to realize — and what I’ll emphasize in this post — is that the compromises we often make when optimizing for development speed can actually slow us down. More succinctly:

<mark>If you want to move faster, you have to slow down.</mark>

Allow me to demonstrate this concept in a few key areas of software development.",
